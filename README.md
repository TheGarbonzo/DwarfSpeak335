# DwarfSpeak  

Transform your chat messages into the gruff, hearty speech of Azeroth's dwarves! This addon replaces common phrases with authentic Dwarven equivalents from the Wrath of the Lich King era.

## Features

  200+ phrases modeled after WotLK dwarf NPCs ("Aye!" "By th' Anvil!" "Ironforge!")  
- **Context-Aware Replacement**  
  Handles verb tenses and nouns separately ("healing" → "mendin'", "healer" → "mender")  
- **MMO Slang Support**  
  Converts "gg", "omw", "brb", "lfg" into Dwarven equivalents ("Stone-solid work!", "Comin' through!")
